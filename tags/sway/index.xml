      <description>Hey all! You know that I shared my latest setup in the previous blog post and if you noticed that there is a shortcut in the sway configurations to start/stop screen recording with wf-recorder. Yesterday, I just realized that I accidentally hit the shortcut and started a recording on background and my computer was about the cry after probably a couple of hours. So I decided to create an indicator for the waybar to show ongoing screen recording.</description>

      <description>I told you I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a love with tiling window managers for a while since I&amp;rsquo;m a keyboard person. For me, if there is a shortcut to do something then use it, otherwise assign a shortcut. So tiling window managers are my thing but I must say it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible for a starter. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that much experience on Linux OS probably you will get nuts if something goes wrong, and believe me probably something will go wrong.</description>
